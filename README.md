# 📡 SMS Fraud Detection – Data Science Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to detect fraudulent SMS messages using machine learning techniques to prevent phishing, scams, and spam.  

## 🎯 Objective  
To develop a classification model that accurately identifies fraudulent SMS messages and reduces scam risks.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, TensorFlow.
- **NLP Techniques:** Tokenization, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings  
- **Modeling:** Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes.

## 🚀 Steps  
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Cleaning and tokenizing SMS data.  
2. **Feature Engineering** – Using TF-IDF, word embeddings, or bag-of-words.  
3. **Model Training & Evaluation** – Applying classification models and tuning hyperparameters.  
4. **Performance Metrics** – Evaluating using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## 📌 Outcome  
- Improved fraud detection accuracy  
- Reduced false positives and false negatives  
- Enhanced SMS security against scams
